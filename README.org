* ðŸ”± Emacs

/An environment for writing software./

Lightweight by design, to assist and not get in the way of developing software. This setup was created with a spartan mindset - constraints enforce deeper engagement.

** Philosophy

*Flow over interruption.* This setup intentionally separates writing from validation. No syntax highlighting, no real-time error checking, no LSP interruptions. The goal is to write down exactly what's in your mind without tool interference, then get feedback from the actual compiler/interpreter.

Like drawing with pen and paper vs. a diagram tool that forces you to select pre-defined shapesâ€”sometimes the tool constraints interrupt the creative process. Code clarity emerges from clear thinking, not colorful text.

*Simplicity constraints:*
- 300 lines max for source code (small enough to reason about)
- 100 lines max for config files  
- 80 character width limit (readability)
- Complex projects: small/surgical changes only
- Projects you own: make them extremely simple
